# How to run and edit
What I do is make a RAID (3 HDD's) and then it mounts on the computer (df). Find the address and then clone the repo into the UDID of the RAID. Also set the caching in the opencomputers config to false or it won't pull chnages from the local copy.

I'm going to document everything eventually. Right now it it for ComputerCraft's IPv2. I'll add an OpenComputers section once there is sufficient progress.
